### InteliEQ Website Redesign
## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to redesign InteliEQ’s marketing website to better reflect their vision as a cleantech company at the intersection of indoor air quality, human health, and energy intelligence.
We aim to deliver a modern, multi-page, responsive website that communicates InteliEQ’s mission, showcases their technology (Symphony-iQ), and provides clear messaging tailored to different audiences, especially decision-makers in healthcare and commercial environments.

## Key Objectives

- Redesign website with a clean, engaging, and visual layout
- Create multi-page, responsive React/Next.js site
- Clarify and simplify messaging and storytelling
- Develop visual elements (graphics, icons, simple animations)
- Integrate AI chatbot for visitor interaction
- Build scalable framework for future growth

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
